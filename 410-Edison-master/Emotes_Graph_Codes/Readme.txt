1. Codes are in python 3.7
2. 3 different codes. 
	i.) chp_based is for chapter based graphs
	ii.) emote_based is for emotion based graphs for all chapters
	iii.) best_of_emotes is for getting the best emotion for each chapter for all chapters
	
3. best_of_emotes: Small problem = "fear" seems to have the highest average. So only fear seems to show
					for all chapters and characters although I haven't tried for all characters
